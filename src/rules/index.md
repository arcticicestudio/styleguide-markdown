<p align="center">This section contains rules for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Markdown</a> with support for <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a> which is based on the <a href="http://commonmark.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CommonMark</a> specification.

Markdown is a [lightweight markup language][wiki-lightweight_markup_language] with plain text formatting syntax for writing structured documents. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

As the initial specification of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown in many languages appeared over the years to answer these issues. Some extended the original Markdown syntax with conventions for footnotes, tables, and other document elements and allowed Markdown documents to be rendered in many formats other than HTML.

Today the most used specifications are [CommonMark][] and its superset [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm] which powers the content of many large websites like GitHub, StackOverflow, and Reddit used by millions of people. And Markdown started to be used beyond the web, to author books, articles, slide shows, letters, and lecture notes.
